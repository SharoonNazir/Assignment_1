      Earlier today, we reported that the federal government is gearing up to
      raise petrol price in Pakistan by Rs. 7.67 per liter for the next 15 days.
      The Ministry of Finance consulted with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and
      the result is here. The government has increased the price of petrol by
      Rs. 9.99 per liter, while the price of high-speed diesel has surged by Rs.
      6.18 per liter. The new prices are effective July 16, 2024. From now on,
      the new prices of petrol and diesel will be Rs. 275.60 and Rs. 283.63 for
      the next fortnight.Earlier, there were reports that petrol price is likely
      to surge by Rs. 7.67 per litre, whereas high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs.
      3.72 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of kerosine oil and light diesel oil
      was expected to increase by Rs. 2.39 and 0.92 per litre. Not surprisingly,
      the reason behind the upcoming price hike is again the uptrend witnessed
      in the international oil market. According to the media reports, the
      global prices of petrol and HSD had ticked up by Rs. $4.4 and $2,
      respectively, in the last fortnight.

      There were also indications that further petrol price hikes will be
      introduced in future revisions because an additional petroleum levy of Rs.
      20 per litre is yet to be inflicted on petrol and diesel prices. Prime
      Minister Shahbaz Sharif has also admitted to the upcoming price hike,
      adding that it will not happen in a single take but in different phases.
      Sources revealed that an additional petroleum levy of Rs. 5 may add to the
      fuel prices. If that were the case, it would take the petrol and
      high-speed diesel (HSD) to the price of Rs. 290.59 per litre and Rs.
      288.63 per litre, respectively, with a cumulative jump of Rs. 14.99 and
      Rs. 11.18 per litre.
